# Forecast WebAPI

The server-side code of the web application resides here.

The project is a simple web application which receives the geographic coordination and returns the saved weather information to the user.

The returned data is not real for now :)

Frontend code can be found [here](https://github.com/Sesota/forecast-ui)
